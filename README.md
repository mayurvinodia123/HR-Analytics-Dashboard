HR Analytics Dashboard
Overview:
I recently worked on an HR Analytics Dashboard, designed to help HR teams and management make better decisions by identifying employee attrition trends and workforce patterns.
Key Highlights:
1.	General Workforce Overview:
o	Total Employees: 1,470
o	Attrition Count: 237 employees
o	Attrition Rate: 16.1%
o	Average Age: 37 years
o	Average Salary: 6.5K (currency not specified)
o	Average Years at Company: 7.0 years
2.	Attrition by Gender:
o	Male attrition is higher (140) compared to females (79), indicating a potential area to explore gender-specific retention strategies.
3.	Attrition by Education:
o	Attrition rates are highest among employees with a background in Life Sciences (38%) and Medical fields (27%), while other fields like Technical (14%) and Marketing (15%) see relatively lower attrition.
4.	Attrition by Age Group:
o	Employees aged 26â€“35 years show the highest attrition (116), followed by the 18â€“25 age group (44). Employees above 46 have notably lower attrition.
5.	Attrition by Salary Slab:
o	The majority of attrition (163) occurs among employees earning up to 5K, indicating that salary could be a contributing factor.
6.	Attrition by Job Role:
o	Certain roles, such as Laboratory Technician (62), Sales Executive (57), and Research Scientist (47), experience higher attrition rates.
7.	Attrition by Year at Company:
o	Attrition peaks in the first year (58) and decreases significantly after 5 years of tenure, highlighting the need for better onboarding and early engagement strategies.
Recommendations Focus on Employee Retention:
o	Tailor retention strategies for high-risk groups, such as employees aged 26â€“35 and those in lower salary brackets.
o	Conduct exit interviews to understand why specific roles and education groups have higher attrition.
2.	Compensation Analysis:
o	Review salary structures, especially for employees earning up to 5K, to ensure competitiveness and fairness.
3.	Role-Specific Engagement:
o	Provide targeted career development opportunities for roles with high attrition, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.
4.	Onboarding Programs:
o	Strengthen onboarding and mentoring for new hires to reduce first-year attrition rates.
